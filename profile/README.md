- <span style="font-size: 25px;">__Single-cell human brain development atlas__.</span><br>
Ongoing project aiming to curate and integrate an extensive collection of Single-cell resolution dataset from developing human brain.<br>
At the current stage the resource encompasses:  **14 among atlases and single-cegion datasets**, **31 distinct PCW** (7 to 33), **4 Major brain areas** and and **6 subregions** for the cortical area.<br>
The resource is meant to provide both harmonized data and a set of methods to facilitate the extension with new datasets, integration, differential expression and comparative analysis.
